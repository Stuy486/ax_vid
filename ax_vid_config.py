DATA_HZ = 30 # Frequency of cone comparison for alignment. Higher is better, but slower
#OUTPUT CONTROL
OUTPUT_ANNOTATED_VIDEOS = False # Output copies of the input videos, but with cones annotated
OUTPUT_TIME_SLIP_VIDEO = True # Output the side-by-side time slip video

OUTPUT_FPS = 60 # Broken with USE_POLY_KEY_FRAME_SMOOTHING.
#TUNABLES
TARGET_DTW_AVERAGE_SCORE = 180 # 255 max, lower means more "gain" in cost matrix
COST_MATRIX_RECENTER_INTERVAL = 16 # seconds, controls how frequently we estimate time slip while calculating cost matrix
MAX_TIME_SLIP_PER_SECOND = .3 # In seconds. Increase if speed of one run is substantially different from the other. Larger value increases cost matrix creation time
USE_POLY_KEY_FRAME_SMOOTHING = True # Use polynomial smoothing when traversing path. Video is processed frame-by-frame rather than timestamp-to-timestamp, much faster
KEY_FRAME_COST_THRESHOLD = 200 # 255 max, higher means fewer but more confident key frames
MIN_KEY_FRAME_DELTA = 3.0 # seconds. Lower can result in more frequent key frames. With data that doesn't line up well, this is mostly bad
                          # because you end up with errant key frames close together, resulting in unrealistic (and incorrect) time slip.
MAX_KEY_FRAME_DELTA = 8.0 # seconds. Higher will result in a smoother time slip graph, and more accurate on the macro scale. Lower
                          # might have more details, but is more prone to error. 6-10 seems to be the sweet spot for.
TARGET_CONES_PER_FRAME = 5 # Target average number of cones per frame. Higher will take longer to generate cost matrix, but it will be more accurate.
